					<h2 class="center">The classic, hard to beat</h2>
					<p>The Battletech tabletop wargame, originally published in 1984, was the starting point for the franchise, and has remained the central part of it ever since. The game has seen innumerable expansions and revisions over the years, as well as several spin-offs. As for how it compares to other tabletop wargames, Battletech is infamous for the relatively high levels of math involved; with players having to consult charts and sheets more often than not. Thankfully, a lot of the more complicated rulesets are opt-in, meaning players can ignore certain aspects at leisure.</p>
					<p>Initially focusing entirely on the mechs, the game was later expanded to include all manner of combat units. Rules exist to implement tanks, infantry, aerospace fighters, waterborne ships, and even entire spaceborne warships wielding enough firepower to level a city. However, the ruleset only gets more complicated the further a combatant is detached from a mech, meaning at most the average game will feature tanks, and maybe some specific use case infantry.</p>
					<p>The game is played on a hexagonal grid. Every unit occupies one hex, though there are rules for certain units being carried by certain other units. Every round of gameplay is broken up into phases, primarily the movement and shooting phases. In the movement phase, every unit can walk, run, or (in some cases) jump. All movement generates heat (which we'll get to in a moment), with jumping generating the most and walking generating the least. Not moving is also an option. In the shooting phase, every unit can fire any weapon it has at any target. Weapons have different ranges at which they're effective, different accuracy bonuses, etc, so knowing when to use what weapon is important. All weapons generate heat as well. Units have a certain amount of heat they can cool every round; if the total heat they generated in a round is greater than this amount, then they will have degraded performance (such as less movement or accuracy) in the next.</p>
					<h2 class="center">A new game for a new age</h2>
					<p>The biggest criticism of Battletech by far has always been its raw complexity. Compared to contemporary wargames such as Warhammer or others, every individual unit in a game of battletech is orders of magnitude more complex to manage. Because of this, a typical game of Battletech would seldom feature more than a "Lance" of 4 mechs, as any more than this could cause the game to stretch on for hours.</p>
					<p>To circumvent this, the <span class="italic cColour">Alpha Strike</span> ruleset was created. Debuting in 2013, Alpha Strike aimed to provide a much simplified game, streamlining it to allow for larger armies to be played without taking days to finish a game. Instead of taking place on a hexagonal grid, the game can be played on any surface, with movement being determined by how many inches a unit can move per turn. The units themselves are abstracted away from the complicated weapon sets and armour layouts, instead just having a set firepower and armour value for the whole unit. These simple changes along with many others go a long way to speeding up games, allowing for entire companies or even battaltions of units to be realistically played in a reasonable timeframe.</p>
